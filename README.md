# PasswordGenerator
I have created a password generator using javascript. 

I started by creating generate password button to generate a password when clicked.
I then identified variables:lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
I then initialized empty string for password.

I then wrote the user prompts for desired password lengths and character types.
I also created alerts to appear if the password criteria isn't met.
I then created a length variable and ran a "for loop" to iterate length number of times and run the "generate function" character in it. 
Then I return the resulting string. 
Finally I added an event listener to the generate button.

My password generator creates random passwords for users.
